## Fusion 360 CAD Projects

CAD portfolio showcasing functional and industrial designs developed in Fusion 360.
The projects focus on prosthetic systems, mechanical components, and industrial modeling.

### Prosthetic Arm and Hand Design
Design of a prosthetic arm with an articulated hand, developed in Fusion 360.
The project focuses on functional assembly, finger articulation, and integration between forearm and hand components.
Modeled from scratch as part of a CAD training program, with emphasis on mechanical structure and proportions.
